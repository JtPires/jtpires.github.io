<h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
<br>
<p>By the looks of it, Arngren is an online shopping website. The website contains many items to buy, from toys to actual life necessities.</p>
<ul>
<li>
C: Arngren uses a white background and many colored text so some stuff is easy to read. But some text are on pictures and that can be difficult to read. They should use darker text and set their pictures to a lower opacity.
</li>
<li>
R: Arngren does not use one similar element, they have too many different fonts and color schemes. Arngren should have used one style scheme they liked.
</li>
<li>
A: Arngren does not have proper alignment, pictures are just placed randomly along with the body text. It would look better if their pictures were aligned in one spot.
</li>
<li>
P: Arngren's proximity is probably the worse thing. There is no organization of related elements anywhere. Everything is just spread across the screen. I'd recommend to put similar products near eachother to make browsing easier. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Apple is a very popular tech company and allows customers to view their products online.</p>
<ul>
<li>
C: Apple's contrast for  each section on the main page makes reading text easy and it looks beautiful.
</li>
<li>
R: Apple stays with the same style for their similar elements which are the products being sold.
</li>
<li>
A: Apple also has proper alignment to show what is their latest product, it stands out to catch the viewer's eyes.
</li>
<li>
P: Apple also uses well styled proximity, all similar products are in one area while extra stuff is in another. 
</li>
</ul>
