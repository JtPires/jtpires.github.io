<h2> A cute dog </h2>


<h1 style="color:black;"> All dogs are cute </h1>

<p></p>


<p class="mess" style =" background-color:blue; color:black;"> I beleive that dogs are better than cats and here is why</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dogs are more energetic
</li>
<li>
Dogs are loyal
</li>
<li>
Don't need a litter box
</li>
<li>
Dogs like to have fun
</li>
</ul>


<h4 style="border-style: dotted dashed solid double;">Overall Dogs are just better</h3>

<h1 style="color:black;"> Rating each criteria</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Criteria 1-11 is a major factor in making a website so by messing up the steps i'd rate it 10/10 on importance. 
</li>
<li>
Criteria 12-17 are important too but not as important as setting up the document so i'd rate it as a 7/10 on importance.
</li>
<li>
Criteria 18-30 are all styling properties and these are important to not make a website look bad to viewers. 9/10 for importance.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color:black;"> Suggestions for improvement </h1>
<ul>
<li>
First suggestion is to make sure the file uses proper spelling and does not use caps.
</li>
<li>
Provide proper links and do not use captions as headers.
</li>
<li>
Use proper colors and styling formats.
</li>
<li>
Make the webpage look appealing and readable
</li>
</ul>
